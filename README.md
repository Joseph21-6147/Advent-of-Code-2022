# Advent-of-Code-2022

This repo contains my solutions for the Advent-of-Code 2022 challenge.

The flcTimer.h and .cpp file comprises a generic timer. I use it to measure the elapsed time needed to solve the puzzle parts. The vector_types.h is a generic lib for multiple vector types - heavily inspired by very similar work of Javidx9 - thanks!

Have fun with it!
